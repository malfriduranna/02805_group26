# Setting up the datasets

To run the MovieDataAnalysis.ipynb file you need to download the dataset.zip file from here: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/imdb-movie-reviews-dataset. The 2_reviews_per_movie_raw should be renamed 'reviews'. Additionally, to build the network, you need to download the full MovieLens Latest Dataset from here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/.
